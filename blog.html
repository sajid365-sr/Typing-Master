                  Their main difference is that local storage data does not
                  expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the
                  user closes its browser window.<br />

                  Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a
                  user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page
                  session. Since local storage is not session-based, all the
                  data must be deleted via javascript or manually.<br /><br />
                  Both local and session storages are key-value stores, meaning
                  that they both store data in a dictionary format. The value of
                  each key has to be a string, so if you have complex data
                  structures like objects or arrays, you will need to serialize
                  them using JSON strings.

                  <strong>Block Scope :</strong>
                  <p class="text-dark text-opacity-75">
                    A block scope means a block execution point for JavaScript
                    functions or variables. Variables that defined within a
                    function or a block statement like if-else statements and
                    for statements are blocked scope variables. They can't be
                    accessible from outside their scope. Simply, A block scoped
                    variable means that the variable defined within a block will
                    not be accessible from outside the block.
                  </p>

                  <strong>Global Scope :</strong>
                  <p class="text-dark text-opacity-75">
                    The Javascript global scope is the context where everything
                    in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope
                    includes all variables, objects, and references that are not
                    contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer.
                    functions and variables that declared in the global scope
                    can be accessible from anywhere of the JavaScript file.
                    Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-dark text-opacity-75">
                    In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by
                    the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the
                    global object.

                  <strong>Event Loop :</strong>
                  <p class="text-dark text-opacity-75">
                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's
                    asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a
                    single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it
                    gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                  </p>

                  <strong>Easy Definition :</strong>
                  <p class="text-dark text-opacity-75">
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call
                    Stack and the Callback Queue or Message Queue.<br />
                    If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event
                    from the Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                    which effectively runs it.
                  </p>

                  <strong>Easiest explanation :</strong>
                  <p class="text-dark text-opacity-75">
                    When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or
                    promises... Then these task takes some time to complete
                    internal operations if they have any. If they completed
                    their internal operations or don't have any, then they
                    simply put into message queue or callback queue. Then event
                    loop will firstly execute the call stack tasks and then look
                    for callback or message queue and then execute it..

                5. If we want to access a property that doesn't exist on the object will be an undefined.<br>
                6. Accessing array elements outside of the index range.<br>
                7. If we delete an element from an array and trying to access it will get undefined.<br> 
                8. Set a value derectly as "undefined".
