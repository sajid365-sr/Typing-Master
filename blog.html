                  SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is
                  that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                  sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever
                  a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a
                  unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                  particular tab.

                  In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by
                  the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the
                  global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if
                  statements, for statements, and the like.

                  <strong>Event Loop :</strong> The event loop is the secret
                  behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                  operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data
                  structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.<br /><br />

                  <strong>Easy Definition :</strong>
                  The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack
                  and the Callback Queue or Message Queue.<br />

                  If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from
                  the Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
                  effectively runs it.<br><br>
                  <strong>Easiest explanation :</strong> When any
                  Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises...
                  Then these task takes some time to complete internal operations if they have
                  any. If they completed their internal operations or don't have any, then they
                  simply put into message queue or callback queue. Then event
                  loop will firstly execute the call stack tasks and then look
                  for callback or message queue and then execute it..

                <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is
                hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
                custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth
                noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit
                overflow.
